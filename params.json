  "body": "# London JavaScript Meetup\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n\r\nThe heart of our meetup is people.  This guideline is meant to support a happy, productive, and safe event experience that can welcome new ideas and inspiration  for all attendees of London JavaScript Meetups, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).\r\n\r\nWe gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice that could jeopardise the participation of any person in the meetup group, and we outline in this document expected, as well as prohibited behavior.\r\n\r\n### Expected\r\n\r\n*The following behaviors are expected and requested of all participants to out meetups, including attendees, speakers, and organizers*\r\n\r\n#### Lead by example\r\n\r\nEach individual attending our events  does so on behalf of themselves. This means being considerate of  how your discussions, actions and decisions will represent yourself.\r\n\r\n#### Be respectful\r\n\r\nDisagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We will exercise consideration and respect in our speech and actions, and consider collaboration before conflict.  Ensure all voices are heard, not just the loudest.\r\n\r\n#### Watch your language\r\n\r\nRefrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. This includes gestures and online discussions / back-channels (like the online meetup pages).\r\n\r\n#### Take responsibility for your words & actions\r\n\r\nWe can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them.  If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the wrong.\r\n\r\n#### Look out for each other\r\n\r\nBe mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert an event organizer if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct. If something makes you feel concerned, or worried - even if you’re not sure it’s a violation, it’s better to reach out, than to ignore.\r\n\r\nRemember that event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.\r\n\r\n#### Expect and accommodate cultural and personal differences\r\n\r\nBe mindful that for many, English is a 2nd, 3rd or even 4th language, and to show patience and respect while listening to and conveying ideas. Remember that we come from many cultures and backgrounds. What is friendly in one culture may not be in another. If you’re not sure what is appropriate, just ask.\r\n\r\nRemember that due to personal, religious, or other reasons, not everyone in the group may drink alcohol or even eat certain types of food. Please respect people’s choices and preferences in this regard without question or criticism.\r\n\r\n#### Ask for help\r\n\r\nEveryone is encouraged to ask questions about this Code of Conduct.\r\n\r\n### Unacceptable Behavior\r\n\r\nThe following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable:\r\n\r\n#### Violence and threat of violence\r\n\r\nThis includes incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm.  \r\n\r\nThis includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).\r\n\r\n#### Derogatory language\r\n\r\nHurtful or harmful language related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, age, or socio-economic status. This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they clearly do not identify with.\r\n\r\nIf you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it.\r\n\r\n#### Sexual behavior\r\n\r\nUnwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.\r\nPhysical contact or simulated physical contact (e.g. textual messages like “hug” or “backrub”) without affirmative consent. This includes sharing or distribution of sexualized images.\r\n\r\nOf course you can hug your best friend that you’ve known forever - the key word is consent.  \r\n\r\n#### Disruptive behavior\r\n\r\nSustained disruption of our events, including talks and presentations will not be tolerated.  This includes ‘talking over’ speakers, or influencing crowd actions that are contrary to the direction of the session.\r\n\r\nInfluencing the over-consumption of alcohol, or making derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol.\r\n\r\n#### Instigating\r\n\r\nAdvocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior is the same as committing that behavior yourself, and thus the same consequences apply.\r\n\r\n## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior\r\n\r\nUnacceptable behavior from any meetup participants, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.\r\n\r\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.\r\n\r\nIf an event participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the event, as well as associated and future events without warning.\r\n\r\n#### Reporting guidelines\r\n\r\nIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the organizers team as soon as possible by emailing [alex.lakatos.qa@gmail.com]([alex.lakatos.qa@gmail.com](alex.lakatos.qa@gmail.com))\r\n\r\nAdditionally, event organizers are available to help meetup members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.\r\n\r\n### Addressing Grievances\r\n\r\nIf you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the organizers team at [alex.lakatos.qa@gmail.com]([alex.lakatos.qa@gmail.com](alex.lakatos.qa@gmail.com) with a concise description of your grievance.\r\n\r\n### Scope\r\n\r\nAll meetup participants (attendees, speakers and organizers) are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct in all meetup venues—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to meetup events.\r\n\r\nThis Code of Conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of meetup activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of our meetup members.\r\n\r\n### Contact info\r\n\r\n* Christoffer Noring, Meetup Organizer\r\n\r\n* Alex Lakatos, Meetup Organizer [alex.lakatos.qa@gmail.com](alex.lakatos.qa@gmail.com)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## License and attribution\r\n\r\nThis Code of Conduct is distributed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).\r\nIt has been adapted with few modifications from [Mozilla’s View Source Conference](https://viewsourceconf.org/code-of-conduct/).",
